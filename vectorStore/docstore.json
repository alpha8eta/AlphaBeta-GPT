To this end, grouping users into Organizations makes sense to enable allot of things, including: Allowing for access permissions to be organized at the Org level and access to posts and boards to flow more seamlessly instead of be managed at the individual user level.\n\n**Boards —** Boards, like Organizations add a new structure to Prism that allows you to organize your Team’s ideas, inspirations and insights in new, more meaningful ways. Some of the earliest feedback we received from users was that . Boards also establish a visual hierarchy of posts that enables a sense of priority to emerge.\n\nUnlike boards on consumer oriented sites like Pinterest, the default should not be open to the public when it comes to enterprise collaboration.","metadata":{"id":3}}],["4",{"pageContent":"Unlike boards on consumer oriented sites like Pinterest, the default should not be open to the public when it comes to enterprise collaboration.\n\nOne assumption we are testing with boards is that users will accept having them be open to the entire company by default. We will also allow for private boards down the road, but right now that option isn’t available.\n\n**Favorites** — Favorites lend a notion of _Priority_ that was previously missing in the chronologically ordered feed. We decided to choose ‘Favorite’ similar to the way twitter uses them, instead of Facebook’s ‘like’ because like felt un-professional, as well as mis-fitting for certain kinds of content (bad news for example).\n\n#### Goals\n\nFor this release our goal is to test how adding more structure can better answer the primary question we were getting from users:\n\n> “What am I here for and what kinds of content should I be sharing?”\n\nAnswering this question will hopefully lead to a quicker ‘aha’ moment, for better understanding what kinds of jobs prism can do for the user like:\n\n1.  _Keep my team informed about what everyone else is working on._\n2.  _Let everyone on my team’s voice be heard up-front in the product idea generating and prioritization process_\n3.  _Leverage my entire company to contribute visual bug reports of bugs and issues they find using our product._\n\nThe secondary goal for the release is to start collecting ‘favorite’ data that can later be used to rank items in the feed and on boards. This will be a main focus of a future release.\n\n#### To sum up\n\nWith this latest release, we are making a big bet that adding better structure will help facilitate better communication and organization, leading to hopefully more focused conversations and insights.\n\nWe are also starting to truly fulfill the promise of a collaborative tool instead of one only useful for individuals.","metadata":{"id":4}}],["5",{"pageContent":"We are also starting to truly fulfill the promise of a collaborative tool instead of one only useful for individuals.\n\nAlso, by adding ‘favorites’, we can start building towards a more relevant and ‘smart’ feed of content that will be ordered by the priority of the crowd.\n\n#### Use Cases\n\nSome use cases we are using prism for today.\n\n* Crowd-sourcing feature ideas for your product\n* Keeping track of competitors\n* Increasing transparency into what is getting worked on\n* Giving design feedback\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Qfq-ltq8BArFCkvtOKRr5g.png)\n\nBy [Adam Breckler](https://medium.com/@adambreckler) on [March 31, 2015](https://medium.com/p/8ba9b380b667).\n\n[Canonical link](https://medium.com/@adambreckler/prism-0-2-alpha-8ba9b380b667)\n\nExported from [Medium](https://medium.com) on February 7, 2023.","metadata":{"id":5}}],["6",{"pageContent":"Blink v1.1 \\* { font-family: Georgia, Cambria, \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif; } html, body { margin: 0; padding: 0; } h1 { font-size: 50px; margin-bottom: 17px; color: #333; } h2 { font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 30px 0 0 0; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-top: 33px; color: #333; } h3 { font-size: 30px; margin: 10px 0 20px 0; color: #333; } header { width: 640px; margin: auto; } section { width: 640px; margin: auto; } section p { margin-bottom: 27px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; } section img { max-width: 640px; } footer { padding: 0 20px; margin: 50px 0; text-align: center; font-size: 12px; } .aspectRatioPlaceholder { max-width: auto !important; max-height: auto !important; } .aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill { padding-bottom: 0 !important; } header, section\\[data-field=subtitle\\], section\\[data-field=description\\] { display: none; }\n\nBlink v1.1\n==========\n\nWith v1.1 of Blink the primary goal is evolving blink from personal utility for managing and sharing screenshots to other networks to more…\n\n* * *\n\n### Blink v1.1\n\nWith v1.1 of Blink the primary goal is evolving blink from personal utility for managing and sharing screenshots to other networks to more of a private network for sharing and discovering all kinds of in-app moments and content. In doing so, the aim is to be 10x better than existing saving & sharing solutions on three different dimensions: speed, ease of use & enhancing of context.\n\nRight now the focus of the application is primarily personal and centered around screenshot management (and sharing to collections). In v2, an open question is how does the app look if the screenshot fades away into the background? What if the screenshot is just the functional way to capture any piece of content you see on your screen and quickly share it (image, article, video etc) how does this change the architecture and UX of the app?\n\n#### Four High-level topics\n\n* Organization, Privacy & Sharing Models (enhancing context, ease of use)","metadata":{"id":6}}],["7",{"pageContent":"#### Four High-level topics\n\n* Organization, Privacy & Sharing Models (enhancing context, ease of use)\n* Jobs-to-be-done (enhancing context, speed)\n* Enhancing Context & Expression (Deep-linking + Annotation)\n* Growth features\n\n#### First some Questions\n\nTo start there are four main questions we need good answers to before convincing a user that Blink is a viable or superior alternative to the ‘Cow Paths’ for how they normally save and share screenshots.\n\n1.  **Why would I share through blink when adding a screenshot to a ongoing conversation via imessage/whatsapp**? Current answer: (sharing a blink is more powerful because it has a link back so the context isn’t lost)\n2.  **Why would I share through blink for a screenshot that i just took and want to send to someone to start a new conversation or just show them?** Current answer**:** (because sharing through the blink push notification saves a few steps in the process). **Note:** If a user doesn’t know about or have blink instant enabled, this answer doesn’t apply.\n3.  **Why would I share through blink for a screenshot that is related to another past screenshot or is associated with a ‘topic’ or ‘theme’?** Current answer:  sharing through blink is better because\n\nIdeally we can refine our answers to the above questions that are more easily understood by users like in the following example:\n\n**Example:** Snapchat\n\nQ: Why would i use another app to send selfies to my friends when I already use iMessage or Whatsapp?\n\nA: Because our photos dissapeer (and we also alert you when they are screen-shotted) you can make sure they stay private, plus we give you simple options to annotate your photos and add context to them.\n\n#### 1) Organization,Privacy & Sharing Models\n\n**Collections vs Groups vs Followers**","metadata":{"id":7}}],["8",{"pageContent":"#### 1) Organization,Privacy & Sharing Models\n\n**Collections vs Groups vs Followers**\n\nCollections are passive. Groups are active. Adding a post to a group expects/demands a response. Adding a post to a collection doesn’t require any response. Sharing a post directly with a single person sometimes begs a response, sometimes it’s just an ‘fyi’. Collections are typically topical. Groups are conversational and organized around people.\n\nFollowing accounts seems to work well in a broadcast model with celebrities at the center (e.g: twitter and instagram) and is less relevant to a private content network e.g: whatsapp, messenger, snapchat\n\nFollowing boards works when the information being organized is around topics or certain themes.\n\nCurrently neither of these models map 100% for the most common sharing cases for screenshots, which are: “Here’s something i saw on my screen just now that i wanted to show you”.\n\nOne possible solution to the current set of issues is to consolidate the sharing and add to collection screens into one, and not require adding to a collection. For example:\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yRcTAa5bbBDwzGpUosK-5A.png)\n\nExample of consolidated direct sharing + collection + link source + cross-network sharing screen\n\nAnother possible solution is to consolidate the view/edit and share screens into one and even remove or de-emphasize the ability to ‘add’ to a collection and just emphasize the shortest/direct sharing path possible.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3yr2UonxOzYse0SICoMoXQ.png)\n\nWith Emoji/Annotate fly-out menu and multi-share option\n\n**Private vs Public**\n\nThe current privacy model for blink is currently as follows:\n\n**Accounts:** Private by default (no ability to be public).\n\n_For V2_? How can design the right privacy model to encourage 1:1 and 1:few sharing to a user’s close social graph?","metadata":{"id":8}}],["9",{"pageContent":"**Accounts:** Private by default (no ability to be public).\n\n_For V2_? How can design the right privacy model to encourage 1:1 and 1:few sharing to a user’s close social graph?\n\nSince we already know from our survey that 40% of screenshots are saved for personal consumption. 55% are shared privately, while less than 5% are shared publicly.\n\n**Collections:** Private by default (_can be made public_). Collections can be followed by those who have access, but the fact remains:\n\nMost screenshots are un-related to previous screenshots and are generally speaking, 1-off moments that don’t want or need to be organized in groups.\n\n**Blinks:** Blinks are currently default private and inherit the privacy model from their parent board, but what if i want to share a single blink with a select group of people (e.g: three close friends). How will they be given access to that single blink in v2 and will each of them see who else has access (pinterest model) or each is a more siloed (snapchat model)? Or perhaps some combination of the two models makes sense.\n\nIt’s worth stating that Blinks, and screenshots in general, fall into one of two primary categories. There are some that fit into both, but most are for one purpose or the other.\n\n1.  **save for later for myself** (like a bookmark, evergreen, can be put in a topic )\n2.  **1-off for sharing** (tied to a conversation, communication oriented, not a bookmark).\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*J_GgrV1NVk8cjmsv4VFAKQ.png)\n\nThe Saving &lt;-&gt; Sharing Spectrum\n\nWhichever privacy model we choose needs to reflect this spectrum of user needs for saving vs sharing.\n\n* * *\n\n#### **2) Jobs to be done**\n\nWhat follows is a set of jobs that users are using screenshots for today as well as jobs that \\*could\\* be done with a future version of blink.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1x_YhZrgK8DgEPgt73717Q.jpeg)\n\n**Saving an article to read later (save)**\n\n**Frequency**: OFTEN\n\n**Consideration set:**\n\n* Emailing yourself a link.","metadata":{"id":9}}],["10",{"pageContent":"![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1x_YhZrgK8DgEPgt73717Q.jpeg)\n\n**Saving an article to read later (save)**\n\n**Frequency**: OFTEN\n\n**Consideration set:**\n\n* Emailing yourself a link.\n* Creating a Bookmark in your browser.\n* Saving with Pocket, Facebook, Read-it-Later, Instapaper, Feedly.\n* Not doing anything.\n\n**Idea:** ‘Blink’ to save an article (full content) to read later (for offline / share)\n\n* * *\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tUWw1xFbd1-griLqOtxYlg.jpeg)\n\n**Creating a custom meme or adding a caption to a photo**\n\n**Frequency**: SOMETIMES\n\n**Consideration set:**\n\n* Using a ‘meme generator’ app.\n* Firing up photoshop on the desktop.\n* Opening a photo in SnapChat\n\n**Idea:** ‘Blink’ any photo you see to re-mix a meme out of it with blink cropping & annotation tools (share)\n\n* * *\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4HBNZdnxx7rxO1_5xGT-JQ.jpeg)\n\n**Re-posting an Instagram** (SOMETIMES)\n\n**Consideration set:**\n\n* Taking a screenshot and cropping with Instagram.\n* Using a ‘re-post’ app.\n\n**Idea:** ‘Blink’ any instagram and click ‘re-post’ to repost it via instagram, blink ads automatic attribution and copies caption text to clipboard.\n\n* * *\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5MVkKzErgeLHMF5kK843jA.png)\n\n**Saving an image to the camera roll (**FREQUENTLY)\n\n**Consideration set:**\n\n* Saving the image by holding down or clicking a kebab menu.\n* Taking a screenshot and cropping.\n\n* * *\n\n#### 3) Enhancing Context & Expression\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LKpkjpgzEBggzAaqlYCV2w.png)\n\n**Annotation**\n\n“Annotation” is used as a catch-all term to describe adding or subtracting to the image in some way. Currently the only form of editing like this offered is cropping.

Deep linking also ads value to the recipient of the blink if they want to be able to easily click through to the source for even more context.\n\nCurrent support for deep-linking within the blink app is limited to an ‘_application-level_’ whereby if we can identify the source application we can link the screenshot to application with the generic link toe.g: _spotify:app:mymusicapp_.\n\nTo enhance deep-linking to make it truly useful, we’ll need to parse out the relevant content from the screenshot in order to link it back to the precise screen within the app. e.g: _spotify:app:mymusicapp:artist:Coldplay:song:Christmas%20Lights_\n\nIn certain cases when we are able to accurately extract the right meta data from a screenshot and have a known convention for deep linking we can link directly on an per application-basis like above.\n\nIf we are dealing with an unknown application or deep-linking convention that is not supported within an app, we can fall back on a combination of a keyword search (google, yahoo) to find the top result to link to and attempt to extract a deep-link directly from the source page html.\n\n* * *\n\n#### 4) Growth\n\nWhile all of the above features must be evaluated through the lens of ‘will this help grow blink’ and ‘how fast?’. These particular features are primarily driven through the lens of ‘growth’ and are not necessarily designed to solve any current user problems.\n\n* **Attribution** (e.g: blink logo on screenshot, recognizable ‘card’ layout for sharing publicly)\n* **Address book integration / invite system** (how do i quickly share a screenshot on blink directly with a friend)","metadata":{"id":11}}],["12",{"pageContent":"* **Address book integration / invite system** (how do i quickly share a screenshot on blink directly with a friend)\n* **Make it easier to discover & follow public collections** / **on-boarding** (more collections being followed means more reasons to come back to blink even when not sharing a screenshot to see interesting content)\n* **Notifications **— new posts to boards you follow, comments on your posts, favorites on your posts etc., also ‘read-receipts’ to see who has viewed your blinks.\n\nBy [Adam Breckler](https://medium.com/@adambreckler) on [December 13, 2015](https://medium.com/p/b451592ca42f).\n\n[Canonical link](https://medium.com/@adambreckler/blink-v2-b451592ca42f)\n\nExported from [Medium](https://medium.com) on February 7, 2023.","metadata":{"id":12}}],["13",{"pageContent":"Jobs-to-be-Done: Hiring Mobile Screenshots \\* { font-family: Georgia, Cambria, \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif; } html, body { margin: 0; padding: 0; } h1 { font-size: 50px; margin-bottom: 17px; color: #333; } h2 { font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 30px 0 0 0; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-top: 33px; color: #333; } h3 { font-size: 30px; margin: 10px 0 20px 0; color: #333; } header { width: 640px; margin: auto; } section { width: 640px; margin: auto; } section p { margin-bottom: 27px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; } section img { max-width: 640px; } footer { padding: 0 20px; margin: 50px 0; text-align: center; font-size: 12px; } .aspectRatioPlaceholder { max-width: auto !important; max-height: auto !important; } .aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill { padding-bottom: 0 !important; } header, section\\[data-field=subtitle\\], section\\[data-field=description\\] { display: none; }\n\nJobs-to-be-Done: Hiring Mobile Screenshots\n==========================================\n\nApplying the JTBD framework to the jobs we hire mobile screenshots for.\n\n* * *\n\n### Jobs-to-be-Done: Hiring Mobile Screenshots\n\nApplying the JTBD framework to the jobs we hire mobile screenshots for.\n\nTaking a screenshot on the iPhone is such a simple action, it’s no wonder so many people are taking more and more screenshots than ever before.\n\nThe fact remains, no-one ever takes screenshots without a some kind of intent behind it ([see #3](https://medium.com/@adambreckler/prism-lens-beta-v-2-ca680c891206#.i59h3xtt0)).

On top, in big bold letters he wrote:\n\n> **_“THESE ADS SUCK.”_**\n\nWhat followed next was surprising:\n\n> By early Monday morning, a group of engineers sent out an email with a solution that not only resolved the AdWords problem, but helped transform Google into a major money machine. The episode exemplifies how Google has built a culture that attacks problems — not people . — [The Google way of attacking problems](https://hbr.org/2014/12/the-google-way-of-attacking-problems)\n\n#### Why did this work?","metadata":{"id":19}}],["20",{"pageContent":"#### Why did this work?\n\n1.  **A strong culture of accountability and ownership — **First and foremost, Google already had a culture of accountability and ownership. Since the engineering team felt responsibility for the quality of their code and ownership over the Google search product, they were open to taking this feedback and responding to it.\n2.  **No one person was singled out — **By posting the search result anonymously where everyone could see it, Larry Page made sure that the right audience got to see it (the search engineers) and that no single person was called out or blamed for the result, which would have happened if he sent it out to a particular engineer or engineering team manager.\n\nAs it turns out, often times, simply surfacing the problems can be sufficient.\n\n> The worst problems are those that we can’t see. Yet most training focuses on how to solve problems. This assumes that we know how to surface problems and are surfacing the right ones. No matter how good we get at solving problems, it doesn’t do any good if we’re not solving the right ones. — [_Jamie Flinchbaugh_](http://www.industryweek.com/flinchbaugh)\n\nSo, what are some problems you are facing in your company and why aren’t you talking about them?\n\nBy [Adam Breckler](https://medium.com/@adambreckler) on [February 28, 2016](https://medium.com/p/4892761ea4cb).\n\n[Canonical link](https://medium.com/@adambreckler/these-ads-suck-4892761ea4cb)\n\nExported from [Medium](https://medium.com) on February 7, 2023.","metadata":{"id":20}}],["21",{"pageContent":"Prism.IO April Update \\* { font-family: Georgia, Cambria, \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif; } html, body { margin: 0; padding: 0; } h1 { font-size: 50px; margin-bottom: 17px; color: #333; } h2 { font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 30px 0 0 0; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-top: 33px; color: #333; } h3 { font-size: 30px; margin: 10px 0 20px 0; color: #333; } header { width: 640px; margin: auto; } section { width: 640px; margin: auto; } section p { margin-bottom: 27px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; } section img { max-width: 640px; } footer { padding: 0 20px; margin: 50px 0; text-align: center; font-size: 12px; } .aspectRatioPlaceholder { max-width: auto !important; max-height: auto !important; } .aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill { padding-bottom: 0 !important; } header, section\\[data-field=subtitle\\], section\\[data-field=description\\] { display: none; }\n\nPrism.IO April Update\n=====================\n\nWe’ve been busy making Prism.IO more powerful, easy-to-use, and beautiful.

Some meme-theorists suggest that memes evolve by natural selection (in a manner similar to that of biological evolution). They do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance influencing an individual entity’s reproductive success.\n\nMemes, spread through the behaviors that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and mutate. Like viruses, some memes replicate effectively even when they prove detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.\n\n> “You are nothing more than a creation of genes and memes in a unique environment. Memes are ideas, skills, habits, stories, songs or inventions that are passed from person to person by imitation. They have shaped our minds, leading to the evolution of big brains and language because these served to spread the memes. But the memes with the cleverest trick are those that persuade us that our “selves” really exist. We all live our lives as a lie…\n\n> **…the memes have made us do it** — because giving us the illusion of “self” helps them to survive and spread.” —[Susan Blackmore, The Meme Machine](https://www.amazon.com/Meme-Machine-Popular-Science-ebook/dp/B00814M2BW/)\n\n#### Meme as the Medium\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2UlJmyoRksZsDiMB90LcVw.png)\n\nOne of the first documented memes “It’s a Trap”, 1983","metadata":{"id":24}}],["25",{"pageContent":"#### Meme as the Medium\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2UlJmyoRksZsDiMB90LcVw.png)\n\nOne of the first documented memes “It’s a Trap”, 1983\n\nIn 1990 Terrence McKenna predicted that memes will be prominent form of expression on the internet in the future — and he was absolutely correct. According to McKenna, memes are the “_smallest units of a concept_” competing in “_an environment of information_”.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to trace back the origin of the meme format that is popular on the web today, we can trace early “internet” memes back to the early 1980's.\n\n[**Internet Memes timeline**  <br>_A timeline of Internet Memes events_worldhistoryproject.org](https://worldhistoryproject.org/topics/internet-memes)[](https://worldhistoryproject.org/topics/internet-memes)\n\n* * *\n\n### The Present: The Selfish Meme\n\nTo witness the full power of the Meme in 2016, look no further than how Harambe the Gorilla, whose tragic death [gave rise to the most canonical meme of our time.](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/harambe-the-perfect-meme/498743/)\n\nIn the summer of 2016, The Harambe meme spread like wildfire across the internet before taking on different forms and serving as the carrier of other memes in the process by transforming itself into a medium.\n\nNote how the meme died off before being re-born again even more viral than before.\n\n#### What made the Harambe meme spread so quickly?\n\n> Harambe is the message that became a medium, capable of carrying any signal. — Venkatesh Rao, “[How Harambe became the perfect Meme](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/harambe-the-perfect-meme/498743/)”","metadata":{"id":25}}],["26",{"pageContent":"> Harambe marks the emergence of something akin to a true stock market for culture, where price movements cannot always, or even often, be narrativized, either locally or globally….It is perhaps the sheer meaninglessness of the original episode that made it an ideal candidate for memetic perfection. There is no object lesson in the Harambe story. No greater moral or meaning. No nascent Clint Eastwood movie. Yet the powerful video of a small child being dragged along by a large gorilla demanded a response and emotional resolution. When that resolution could not be found within the limited original context, Harambe broke out into the broader cultural marketplace, seeking, if not narrative interpretation, at least emotional resolution.\n\nHere are some examples of [popular Harambe inspired memes](https://blink.am/b/9062), along with the dozens of ‘[sub-memes](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harambe-the-gorilla)’ (below) which evolved from it.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RHS-869eyXFcpQW6bv_vHg.png)\n\n[Weird Twitter](http://knowyourmeme.com/subculture/weirdtwitter) quickly jumped on turning Harambe into a meme, [photoshopping](http://knowyourmeme.com/subculture/photoshop) into image macros and ironically featuring him alongside photos of Prince, David Bowie, and Muhammad Ali in tributes to famous celebrities that died in 2016.[\\[23\\]](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harambe-the-gorilla#fn23)\n\n* * *\n\n### The Future: Meme-Evolution\n\n> Recently, it seems as though the meme medium is evolving itself in order to further propagate throughout culture.\n\nMeme Evolution Encapsulated in a Screenshot\n\n#### Advice Memes, Post-Memes & Memes as Micro-Religions\n\nOne interesting question in 2016 is what happens when the meme medium begins to evolve beyond it’s incubation period from sites like 4chan, imgur & reddit and begin to spread through mainstream culture?\n\nMemes as “micro-religions”","metadata":{"id":26}}],["27",{"pageContent":"Memes as “micro-religions”\n\nSome memes have even given rise to quasi-religious movements, like [The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-flying-spaghetti-monster), a parody religious organization with followers known as “_Pastafarians_”.

Proof of work_ has expanded, but credentials haven’t caught up**\n\nPart of the debate over current credentialing systems comes down to whether you view credentialing as primarily a responsibility of talent (to self-certify) via a trusted educational institution or as a human capital problem for employers handle by becoming better evaluators of talent.\n\nTo a large extent, the traditional credential, a four-year university degree, has already been un-bundled by savvy employers.\n\nFrom a purely rational economic perspective, going to college makes no sense, yet it still ranks as the most powerful (and costly) form of credentialing/signaling in use today.\n\n> High productivity workers invest in education, but some less productive workers pay the cost too and thereby masquerade as high quality. — The Dynamics of Costly Signaling _(_[_link_](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c3de/5e873fd3e6c043d607b64a4aad51492a1d59.pdf)_)_\n\nThese are some of the current attempts to replace the college degree as a primary means of credentialing:\n\n#### 2\\. Education-based credentialing and the race to the bottom\n\n_Meet the new school, same as the old school._\n\nNew takes on credentialing via education such as Udacity or LambdaSchool offer an unbundled version of the college degree, that leaves out many of the constraints and barriers that exist with traditional educational institutions, including geography, cost, among others.\n\nAt the end of the day, while this approach can work well for offering previously ‘_un-credentialed_’ talent new opportunities to break through and prove themselves directly to employers, it is fundamentally limited by the same sorts of scalability bottlenecks that more traditional educational institution’s face, primarily time and cost.","metadata":{"id":34}}],["35",{"pageContent":"Since Udacity & LamdaSchool are single institutions/accreditors themselves, they both suffer from the same adverse incentives universities face that come from scale, where paradoxically the more students that carry a Lambda or Udacity certification, the less signaling value it offers graduates since the value of the credential is directly tied to the educational brand.\n\n#### 2.1 Employer-based Credentialing\n\n_Meet the new boss, same as the old boss._\n\nWhile it's not really a pure form of credentialing today, it's worth mentioning the various problems with employer-based credentialing: inherent biases, heterogeneous evaluation processes and more.\n\nThe reason these processes can’t form the basis of a universally accepted credential is that Interview scores, Take-home work assignments and other kinds of custom evaluations aren’t portable and are thus silo-ed away within individual organizational walls.\n\nNot to mention the actual work that’s done while employed at a company.\n\n#### 3\\. Experience > Exams, Test just don’t cut it.\n\n_Meet the new exam, same as the old exam._\n\nThe premise behind outsourced certification providers like Triplebyte, Hackerrank, Karat (in coding) or Degreed (in other fields) sounds great in theory.\n\nThey make the process of evaluating a well-defined pool of talent, e.g: software engineers and systemize/standardize it, to the point where it closely resembles something like the SAT. Coupled with an open application process that is maximally inclusive at the top of the funnel and it sounds like a valuable and scalable solution on paper.\n\nThis problem is that this concept only makes sense for:\n\n1.  **An overly simplistic world —** in which hard-skills are the only or primary means by which a potential hire is judged.

Light refracting and stuff.\n\n### Building Prism in Public\n\nUnexpected benefits of opening up our product development process.\n\n#### The Start\n\nStarting off the journey, we had a somewhat blurry vision (some would call it a hallucination) of a hypothetical world where users were landing on prism and sharing “what’s happening right now”, lending their unique context and point of view to any conversation or problem that needed to be solved. The kinds of content we were initially expecting people to share ran the gamut from screenshots of product issues, inspirations of competitors features to insights from analytics charts & graphs.\n\n**Taking a step back:** _At its core_, Prism’s long-term mission is to provide more transparency to the workplace through better contextual communication.","metadata":{"id":47}}],["48",{"pageContent":"**Taking a step back:** _At its core_, Prism’s long-term mission is to provide more transparency to the workplace through better contextual communication.\n\nPrism started out life as a completely open canvas. It was entirely up for the user to decide (or guess) as to what type of content to contribute and what kinds of problems or jobs prism was performing for them.\n\nAlong the early path we were struggling with the first few steps to take to get from here (open canvas) to there -> (canvas full of engaging visual content worth conversing around and sharing).\n\nSome questions that kept resurfacing in our heads included:\n\n_How are we going to communicate the value of prism to new users in less than 15 seconds?_\n\n_How are we going to communicate the value of using something like prism vs the more traditional route of native OS copy and paste to share?_\n\n_How are we going to communicate the use cases for contributing content to prism vs the existing alternatives, email, trello or slack?_\n\nWhen we began to ask these questions of our selves, we realized we didn’t have straight-forward answers.\n\nThis is when we decided to **_immediately stop listening to customer feedback_** and go through a 2 week long process of using prism for ourselves for our own product development process to generate ideas, inspirations and feedback for new use cases and product features that we would use.\n\n#### The Insight\n\nDuring this time we started using prism to build prism by inviting select groups of our alpha tester community, at the time about 100, to give their feedback on things like our logo design and product homepage.\n\nThe initial response was very strong. As it turns out giving feedback is a much more lighter weight action than contributing content to receive feedback or setting up a board to solve a business problem and inviting colleagues (duh!).\n\n**Example:** Here’s how we  used prism to get feedback on our logo.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pSP2OazJW2F5AiVE66f2jw.png)","metadata":{"id":48}}],["49",{"pageContent":"**Example:** Here’s how we  used prism to get feedback on our logo.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pSP2OazJW2F5AiVE66f2jw.png)\n\nThe evolution of our logo from the triangle on the left, to the ‘snapshot’ inspired prism lens icon on the far right ->\n\nThe result of this experiment was a much improved output (logo) than we would have otherwise been able to make and by being able to leverage so many different points-of-view in the process who were ‘outside of the building’, we were able to act in a much more un-biased way to the feedback.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*xTNA4Lnstft-4FYn456vtA.png)\n\nThe logo we arrived at after many rounds of feedback\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\n**Lesson #1:** While initially it felt slightly uncomfortable to open up our current product process and future plans to people, some of whom we don’t even know personally, the benefits of being transparent have far outweighed any perceived downsides thus far.\n\nReceiving honest and direct feedback is kind-of like ripping off a band-aid, again, and again…and again.\n\nThe more times you do it the easier it gets.\n\n**Lesson #2**: Providing a light-weight form of capturing feedback is very valuable, since you don’t want to waste the time of the person who is giving you their feedback. Streamlining this experience will be a key differentiator for prism in the future and is a key product learning.\n\n**Lesson #3:** The other lesson that we learned was that people in the community (people building products) are extremely generous with their time because they fundamentally believe that ‘paying it forward’ tends to pay off over time.\n\n#### What’s Next?\n\nFollowing the success of our dog-fooding experiment within the product/design/branding use-case, we aim to continue to increase the level of transparency even further and see where it take us...\n\nSome ideas we have right now are to:","metadata":{"id":49}}],["50",{"pageContent":"Some ideas we have right now are to:\n\n1.

Its not exactly the epitome of design we know and love their service for today, but it was the start of something big.\n\n### Third time’s a charm\n\nThe original idea for what became Airbnb was a clever way for design conference participants (co-founders Joe and Brian) to find and rent out their apartment space to make money. There were many iterations along the way to their eventual success, but the three following versions where the most important evolutionary steps.\n\n**Version 1**: Rent out your mattress to a fellow conference goer from out of town.

It’s the equivalent of “here’s what I’m seeing right now” or “here’s what i’m working on currently”.\n\nDespite sharing ad-hoc screenshots today via tools like [prism (web)](https://medium.com/@adambreckler/prism-0-1-alpha-d401cb09a3a5), email, chat apps and project management tools, users would prefer a more seamless way of capturing and sharing the screenshots they take (especially on mobile, where the pain is more acute).\n\nIn fact the act of taking an sharing a screenshot today, resembles something more akin to a hack or user ‘desire path’ than a well thought out and designed workflow that seamless integrates into other workflows.","metadata":{"id":72}}],["73",{"pageContent":"**Assumption #2:** A tool focused on capturing and sharing screenshots must be general purpose enough to fit into a broad enough range of use cases and provide value from day 1 without any upfront investment or change in behaviour.\n\nThis also implies that prism lens must be useful in both a professional setting (e.g: sharing app design inspiration or a bug report) and personal setting with varied use cases (sharing a screenshot of a text conversation or funny tweet). There simply doesn’t seem to be enough space in users head’s for remembering to use a screenshot sharing app that is only meant for a single purpose or narrow set of use cases.\n\n#### Goals\n\nEven though sharing a screenshot can be a relatively painless experience for some, most people get a sense that there could be a more optimal way to be capturing, sharing and organizing their screenshots.\n\nIn fact it turns out that the typical sharing flow alone takes **_11 actions_** and **_40 seconds today!_**\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1jH2vsskQmNPh26fQVT2fg.png)\n\n> Since taking a screenshot is now starting to become ingrained as a natural user behavior, any tool meant to enhance this behavior must simultaneously tap into the existing behavior while not interrupting it.\n\nFor this reason we are designing prism lens to tap into the native user behavior by detecting a screenshot event and then presenting itself in context of the app/experience.\n\n**Step 1**: Take a screenshot (native), **Step 2:** Prism lens triggers a sharing dialog. **Step 3:** User adds a message and hits ‘share’!\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Qphb042USaR-Vx4qo0-Z4A.gif)\n\nFor v.1 of the app we are focused on building a useful ‘single-player’ experience for capturing & sharing screenshots, but could easily imagine a version down the road where (users|colleagues|connections) shared screenshots organized by app (product), content topic (#customer-acquisition, #design) or team (#marketing, #sales, #ux).","metadata":{"id":73}}],["74",{"pageContent":"Other things that we are considering now but require future discovery and experimentation before building out include:\n\n1.  **‘Boards**’ and other organization & collaboration, communication functionality like comments that we have in the web app, but are not yet obviously useful in a mobile context.\n2.  **An API** for 3rd party app developers to integrate and build on top of our ‘smart’ screenshot sharing functionality.\n3.

Again, the findings are clear: for groups that value innovation and new ideas, diversity helps.\n\n**Hypothesis #5:** Most ideas (both good and bad ones) fade out too quickly, un-captured, un-shared, un-documented.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6JGdMv3RZ0Idtn5P0apy4g.png)","metadata":{"id":87}}],["88",{"pageContent":"**Hypothesis #5:** Most ideas (both good and bad ones) fade out too quickly, un-captured, un-shared, un-documented.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6JGdMv3RZ0Idtn5P0apy4g.png)\n\nEven the best ideas are often too fleeting to be pinned down.\n\nIn order to capture the best ones you must trap your ideas as they happen.

It’s the equivalent of “here’s what I’m seeing right now” or “here’s what i’m working on currently”.\n\nEven though sharing a screenshot can be a relatively painless experience for some, most people get a sense that there is a more optimal way to be sharing their screenshots for posterity sake and for better visual collaboration with co-workers.\n\nSimply put, the act of taking a screenshot should be both a delightful experience as well as enhance both the historical record (documentation, retrievability, searchability) and collaboration around that piece of information simultaneously.\n\n#### Goals","metadata":{"id":100}}],["101",{"pageContent":"#### Goals\n\nWe think that we can build a lightweight enough workflow through a browser extension and web app, that will allow people to create ‘[cards](http://blog.intercom.io/why-cards-are-the-future-of-the-web/)’ from their screenshots and share them quickly and easily through whichever communications platform they are already using today.\n\nOur focus will be heavily weighted towards private sharing, both within companies and across organizations.\n\nThis means that we will start integrating with existing communication channels like slack, trello and email in mind and build out other integrations going forward based on demand.\n\nThese cards will act as both self-contained snapshots of information as well as portable units of content that can transmit context across platforms and display natively within their parent container or app wherever they are shared.\n\nFor v.1 we are focused on building a useful ‘single-player’ experience for uploading screenshots, but could easily imagine a version where you see in-app your colleagues shared screenshots organized by topic (#customer-acquisition) or team (#marketing).\n\n#### On Customization\n\nCustomization of cards needs to be really light. An assumption is that the commentary happens outside of the card itself, even though we have built out a commenting feature on top of the existing card.\n\nThings like annotation and other collaborative features that provide value to multiple parties are for future development.\n\n#### To sum up\n\nAgain the experience challenge is that the prism card has to look good but not so stuffy that it doesn’t feel like it came from a human. The overall experience of the app needs to be fast because we are competing with the native use case of just screenshotting, cropping, annotating and sharing.\n\nOverall, it ‘just needs to work’. But also add additional value on top of the existing workflow.\n\n### Use Cases and Example Images\n\n**#1 Daily Updates**\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*qdq8IoBxqRVFASkV3284aQ.png)","metadata":{"id":101}}],["102",{"pageContent":"### Use Cases and Example Images\n\n**#1 Daily Updates**\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*qdq8IoBxqRVFASkV3284aQ.png)\n\nAdam a chart of recent prism posting activity along with a selfie (a new daily ritual)\n\nRecently someone suggested that it might be useful to try to replace the daily update with a dual screenshot+selfie, so we started trying it at prism.\n\nIt turns out to be a useful method for sharing updates and also allot of fun!\n\n**#2 Curating snippets of articles**\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*HbrXqthLWqHnF6i1Frtn7A.png)\n\n[http://blog.intercom.io/the-end-of-apps-as-we-know-them/](http://blog.intercom.io/the-end-of-apps-as-we-know-them/)\n\nWe suspected that there would be more compelling use cases, but it turns out the simple ability to create a custom card to share a snippet of an article, with custom title, picture and description is useful enough to justify a whole new use case.\n\nRight now we’re using this to keep track of articles with product/design inspiration internally.\n\n**#3 Sharing a bug or design issue**\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*Zs6q_Z1KJqtdQlecd-QCoA.png)\n\nThis use case emerged naturally out of the development process for our alpha.\n\nWe found ourselves copying saving and pasting in screenshots manually into Trello which we use to track bugs and stories.\n\nThis use case also led to the inspiration to build out the prism ‘lense’ chrome extension that posts directly to trello.\n\nBy [Adam Breckler](https://medium.com/@adambreckler) on [March 17, 2015](https://medium.com/p/d401cb09a3a5).\n\n[Canonical link](https://medium.com/@adambreckler/prism-0-1-alpha-d401cb09a3a5)\n\nExported from [Medium](https://medium.com) on February 7, 2023.","metadata":{"id":102}}]]
