Examples of the spectrum of Productivity Apps & Open Network

Recently a new category of companies has started to emerge that can best characterized as ‘_Productivity Networks_’. These Networks share characteristics of classic business ‘Productivity Tools’ as well as modern Social Networks like Twitter and Pinterest.

Productivity Networks assist in the creation, discovery and distribution of content as well as different enterprise ‘workflow’ functions.

Like ‘[Market networks](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/27/from-social-to-market-networks/)’, Productivity networks have multi-sided business models, but instead of monetizing based on marketplace transaction fees, they instead monetize their community members directly via monthly subscription fees for premium workflow tool features.

Simultaneously, a paradigm shift is occurring towards ‘continuous productivity’ in the world of enterprise software where consumers are demanding the same ease of use of their consumer applications at work.

> Continuous productivity is an era that fosters a seamless integration between consumer and business platforms. Today, tools and platforms used broadly for our non-work activities are often used for work, but  under the radar. —_Steven Sinofsky,_ [_Learn by Shipping_](http://blog.learningbyshipping.com/2013/08/20/continuous-productivity-new-tools-and-a-new-way-of-working-for-a-new-era/)

Productivity networks run the gamut from completely open networks to mostly workflow oriented sass tools with minimal network effects.

Some canonical examples of Productivity Networks include:

#### Github

[**Build software better, together**  <br>_GitHub is the best place to build software together. Over 10.4 million people use GitHub to share code._github.com](http://github.com/)[](http://github.com/)

Github started out life as an open network for developers, sharing code, mostly for open source projects. As they have grown and become adopted within the enterprise, now they monetize with ‘Organization’ accounts that include features like private repositories.

By introducing Organizations, they can maintain the existing graph of individual developers firmly in-tact, while allowing for companies to take full advantage of all the tools that GitHub has for their community members.

#### Medium

[**Medium**  <br>_Welcome to Medium, a place to read, write, and interact with the stories that matter most to you. Every day thousands…_medium.com](http://medium.com/)[](http://medium.com/)

Medium initially described itself as a ‘different kind’ of publishing platform.

While Medium shares many similarities in many respects to other publishing platforms like wordpress and blogger before it, it is also a tool for professional networking in a way that previous generations of publishing platforms have not been.

This isn’t a surprise, since they started life based primarily off of the twitter graph, which includes many loose and strong professional connections.

In this respect, many consider Medium, a more direct threat to a site like LinkedIn, because of it’s abundance of professionally oriented content.

However, inside of the enterprise the biggest threat is to other internal productivity tools like MS Office and Google Docs, as workers start becoming accustomed to using it as their primary document authoring platform.

#### Slack

[**Slack: Be less busy**  <br>_We spend 47% of our time just reading, answering, and searching email to gather what we need to do real work. Slack…_slack.com](https://slack.com/)[](https://slack.com/)

While mostly considered an internal business/productivity and communications tool, public Slack [groups have starting to leak outside of the confines of the enterprise](https://pando.com/2015/02/23/consumers-are-using-slack-beyond-the-enterprise-whether-the-company-likes-it-or-not/).

Unlike it’s predecessors Yammer and Jive and during the first wave of ‘Enterprise Social Networking’ which were primarily closed networks within the enterprise, Slack’s user interface is friendly enough and it’s business model forgiving enough to allow for prosumer use across orgs.

This characteristic allows it to spread more quickly across organizations as users at different organizations become exposed to Slack outside of a working context, but then adopt it within the company later.

Companies are starting to add external members, of partners, contractors, advisors and board members to their internal slack groups as a way to replace external email communication as well.

### Why now?

The lines between personal and professional identity are beginning to blur again. Whereas your personal and professional identities used to be cleanly separated (Facebook for personal, LinkedIn for professional), networks like Twitter have started to blur the lines between the two more heavily.

So, what distinguishes Productivity Networks from other Consumer and Enterprise focused SaaS companies like Dropbox, Evernote or Trello?

### It’s the network.

Productivity networks typically start out life as open, or semi-closed networks as opposed to the other way around.

While Productivity tools like Dropbox certainly have strong networks associated with their use (colleagues, close family and friends), they don’t have a public identity or a network associated with each users account.

Productivity networks on the other hand first establish their own _public_ social graph from the ground up or an existing public graph (by layering on top follow features) and add in privacy controls later on that help companies and users segment their usage of the network between public and private.

This is why Productivity Networks are so powerful. They combine the advantage of network effects from traditionally consumer-only social networks and the _get-shit-done_ capabilities of powerful enterprise software.

So the only question is: Which categories of software are safe from disruption by Productivity Networks and which are about to be disrupted?
