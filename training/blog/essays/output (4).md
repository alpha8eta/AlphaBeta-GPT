### Smarter Screenshots

If an image is worth 1,000 words…how much is a mobile screenshot that captures the full context of a digital moment worth?

How about a ‘**_smart_ _screenshot_**‘ that captures not only the visual information on the screen, but also the meta-data behind the screen including things like source url, app where the screenshot was taken and the full content below current app view?

Some have even gone as far as calling the screenshot “[the most important think on the internet](http://www.wired.com/2015/03/clive-thompson-6/)”.

So, what happens when the screenshot evolves beyond a static image?

It’s amazing that the behavior of taking a screenshot on our ‘smart-phones’ (recently introduced to Android phones) has gone more or less unchanged since Apple introduced it seven years ago with the first iPhone.

In fact the feature itself was never meant to be used by the average user, which is why Apple has never advertised it in their manuals. But as people became more proficient in smartphone usage, the knowledge of its existence has spread largely by word of mouth.

Now more and more people are relying on the feature for [all kinds of tasks](https://medium.com/@adambreckler/jobs-to-be-done-hiring-mobile-screenshots-b56da5e1a33a#.psjk92isp) including: capturing design inspiration, bug reports, saving map directions, reminders for paying bills, screenshots of text conversations and tweets etc, etc.

Yet the screenshot itself has not evolved to keep up with this ever expanding set of use-cases for which it’s being used. The fact is,

> People take screenshots with a goal in mind.

What follows is a thought exercise around what a truly ‘_smart_’ screenshot would look like and what would be the key set of attributes it might have that would help people accomplish their goals in a more seamless way (using screenshots).

#### Contextual

Smart screenshots should be able to understand which app or website they originated from just like a link. A screenshot of a tweet from twitter should ‘prefer’ being shared on twitter, since that’s where it will most often be shared.

Likewise, a screenshot of a text conversation should also know where it came from and make it easy to quickly share it via sms, or at least prevent you from mistakenly sharing the conversation with the person who you screen-shotted...

Quickly sending a text conversation to a friend via sms.

#### Semantic

Sharing a screenshot on one platform (facebook, twitter, gmail) shouldn’t mean that the meta-data behind the screenshot should be cut off as soon as it’s shared from its underlying source.

Smart screenshots should be able to ‘transport’ relevant meta-data across devices & platforms just as an api would but instead without any integration from a developer.

Sending a screenshot to a 3rd party service with a link back to the source.

#### Expressive

Smart screenshots should allow for a full palette of expression beyond just the original image on the screen. A truly expressive includes annotation with text/glyph/arrows and color choice and stroke width controls.

Basic and or smart cropping & blurring also falls into this bucket as well.

Adding an annotation directly on the image.

#### Responsive

Smart screenshots should be responsive, not just in terms of size and layout but in terms of cropping and re-sizing.

Why should I have to crop out the browser ui or batter level from my screenshot if i don’t need it there?

Saving a screenshot of some good design or product inspiration.

#### Functional

Smart screenshots should function like mini-apps, or ‘cards’ complete with card features like [context, a lens and triggers](https://speakerdeck.com/christse/patterns-of-card-ui-design) that allow for actions to be taken like downloading an app, triggering a deep-link into another app or simply setting an email reminder.

Opening a deep link back to the originating app.

#### Self-contained

Have you ever taken a screenshot of a map for fear that you wouldn’t have good internet access later while traveling and needed help navigating?

Smart screenshots could allow you to navigate using only gps by storing an offline ‘cache’ of the route overlaying it on top of your screenshot.
