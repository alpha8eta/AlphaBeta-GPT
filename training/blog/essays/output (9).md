Our new logo mark ‘blink’

### Introducing Blink

Recently we started looking for a new name for our [_screenshot sharing app/network_](http://prism.io) _called ‘prism.io’._ While we liked the name ‘Prism’, it didn’t seem to fit our ambitions to build out a [ubiquitous utility & network around sharing screenshots](https://medium.com/@adambreckler/atomic-elements-networks-1800ee3279c2?source=your-stories).

In our search for a new name, one stood out above the others, both in it’s unique memorability as well as fit for the brand we want to build.

‘B_link_’ was first recommended by a close friend & advisor because of its striking similarity with the action of taking a screenshot. “Its almost like your screen is blinking at you”. We immediately fell in love with it.

Why? A **_blink_** **_describes the action_** of saving or sharing:

> “Just **blink** to save it” or “Let me quickly blink it to you” or “Let me send you a blink of that”

B_link_ also has the word ‘**_link_**’ prominently displayed inside of it. In this sense a blink is also a combination of the words ‘bookmark’ + ‘link’.

**What are blink’s core brand and product values?**

We wanted a name that would communicate the following values for our brand as well as be easy to pronounce and memorable.

1.  _Speed_
2.  _Smart / Clever_
3.  _Privacy / Security_

**What is a ‘blink’?**

A **_blink_** is simply a card that functions as a visual bookmark of something seen on my mobile device.

Put another way, a blink is a screenshot, with extra super powers…

A **_blink_** is **composed of** the following:

1.  A visual preview (required. derived from the original screenshot in most cases), A source url (web) or app link (app store link or deeplink) — (often but not required)
2.  User generated meta-data: Some description text (optional, today this can be added by the user, future: from the url) Overlayed arrows, text etc. (optional)
3.  Other meta-data: An author, date (optional). View stats, favorites, comments.

**How would the blink brand look and feel?**

V1: First attempt at a branding mark

This seemed like a good enough start, but what would others think of it?

To test our first attempt we ran a google consumer insight survey with mixed results.

[**What do you think about this brand for a screenshot app?**  <br>_Custom market research made easy_www.google.com](https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=bk3htt7yywoss&question=1&filter=&rw=1)[](https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=bk3htt7yywoss&question=1&filter=&rw=1)

The big takeaway from the survey was that we weren’t hitting our brand attribute values strongly enough. Also the logo felt qualitatively too childish for the feel we were trying to achieve.

**Attempt #2**

In our second attempt, we wanted to try a more toned-down approach to both the color scheme and the iconography accompanying the logo.

Blink Version 2

**Attempt #3**

When we set about designing a branding mark for blink, we also wanted something that was able to be easily adapted into an app icon and be instantly recognizable, so we tried to emphasize how the logo would look in icon form.

We also took into account this color wheel of popular app colors found in [various categories on the appstore](https://growthbug.com/the-colors-of-an-app-icon-b5e8805958d7#.yrz7hgzhw), with the conclusion being that most communication oriented apps used some form of blue.

Version 3 — New Color Experimentation

After we got feedback from the community of prism beta testers to narrow down the field some, we ran another set of surveys for the various logo treatments, also asking for free-form questions like the following.

[**What do you like or dislike about this logo?**  <br>_Custom market research made easy_www.google.com](https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=z6upw33cibaqs&question=1&filter=&rw=1)[](https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=z6upw33cibaqs&question=1&filter=&rw=1)

Tagcloud of user respones

What stood out was, while users liked the overall feel of the logo, they didn’t like the particular color we chose.

Finally we asked…

[**What values does this brand logo communicate to you?**  <br>_Custom market research made easy_www.google.com](https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=t7hnkgmzmxw36&question=1&filter=&rw=1)[](https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=t7hnkgmzmxw36&question=1&filter=&rw=1)

Great success! A whopping **_48%_** agreed it communicated ‘speed’, 27% for ‘smarts’ and 24% for ‘security’. In total 2–10x improvement on each attribute.

Now it was just a matter of tweaking the colors based on the feedback.

**The Final result**
