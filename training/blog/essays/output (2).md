Building Prism in Public
========================

Or, how we dog-fooded our mvp to early product-market fit by practicing what we preach and being more transparent.

How a prism works. Light refracting and stuff.

### Building Prism in Public

Unexpected benefits of opening up our product development process.

#### The Start

Starting off the journey, we had a somewhat blurry vision (some would call it a hallucination) of a hypothetical world where users were landing on prism and sharing “what’s happening right now”, lending their unique context and point of view to any conversation or problem that needed to be solved. The kinds of content we were initially expecting people to share ran the gamut from screenshots of product issues, inspirations of competitors features to insights from analytics charts & graphs.

**Taking a step back:** _At its core_, Prism’s long-term mission is to provide more transparency to the workplace through better contextual communication.

Prism started out life as a completely open canvas. It was entirely up for the user to decide (or guess) as to what type of content to contribute and what kinds of problems or jobs prism was performing for them.

Along the early path we were struggling with the first few steps to take to get from here (open canvas) to there -> (canvas full of engaging visual content worth conversing around and sharing).

Some questions that kept resurfacing in our heads included:

_How are we going to communicate the value of prism to new users in less than 15 seconds?_

_How are we going to communicate the value of using something like prism vs the more traditional route of native OS copy and paste to share?_

_How are we going to communicate the use cases for contributing content to prism vs the existing alternatives, email, trello or slack?_

When we began to ask these questions of our selves, we realized we didn’t have straight-forward answers.

This is when we decided to **_immediately stop listening to customer feedback_** and go through a 2 week long process of using prism for ourselves for our own product development process to generate ideas, inspirations and feedback for new use cases and product features that we would use.

#### The Insight

During this time we started using prism to build prism by inviting select groups of our alpha tester community, at the time about 100, to give their feedback on things like our logo design and product homepage.

The initial response was very strong. As it turns out giving feedback is a much more lighter weight action than contributing content to receive feedback or setting up a board to solve a business problem and inviting colleagues (duh!).

**Example:** Here’s how we  used prism to get feedback on our logo.

The evolution of our logo from the triangle on the left, to the ‘snapshot’ inspired prism lens icon on the far right ->

The result of this experiment was a much improved output (logo) than we would have otherwise been able to make and by being able to leverage so many different points-of-view in the process who were ‘outside of the building’, we were able to act in a much more un-biased way to the feedback.

#### Lessons Learned

**Lesson #1:** While initially it felt slightly uncomfortable to open up our current product process and future plans to people, some of whom we don’t even know personally, the benefits of being transparent have far outweighed any perceived downsides thus far.

Receiving honest and direct feedback is kind-of like ripping off a band-aid, again, and again…and again.

The more times you do it the easier it gets.

**Lesson #2**: Providing a light-weight form of capturing feedback is very valuable, since you don’t want to waste the time of the person who is giving you their feedback. Streamlining this experience will be a key differentiator for prism in the future and is a key product learning.

**Lesson #3:** The other lesson that we learned was that people in the community (people building products) are extremely generous with their time because they fundamentally believe that ‘paying it forward’ tends to pay off over time.

#### What’s Next?

Following the success of our dog-fooding experiment within the product/design/branding use-case, we aim to continue to increase the level of transparency even further and see where it take us...

Some ideas we have right now are to:

1.  Open up a public board for prism product feedback. Possibly opening up our full product roadmap to ideas [like a team at google is doing](https://trello.com/b/GKotpgkR/devtools-for-designers). Adding more stories from upcoming sprints into
2.  Productize the option to create a public board and invite other members of the prism community who are open to providing feedback and make it clear who is participating in each conversation.
3.  Try opening up boards for different topics outside of the realm of product/design, e.g: marketing tactics, positioning, culture, etc.

If you have any feedback for how we can improve our feedback gathering process or any lessons you have learned in collecting and channeling feedback please reach out to me at adam at prism.io.
