### The Fragility of Ideas

Today’s world is awash in ideas, some are great…[most are not](http://worldsworstideas.tumblr.com/). Then there are the kinds of ideas, like the [assembly line](http://www.bloomberg.com/ss/09/03/0312_game_changing_timeline/2.htm), that have the potential to transform industries.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*zjsyWIuGrqujyPDf9LoG3A.jpeg)

In business, great ideas can come in all shapes and sizes ranging from small, tactical ideas, e.g: a better ui or ux design pattern you saw a competitor use to increase signups.

to large and conceptual, e.g: a new idea for a new adjacent product/service that can be used to win new business or up-sell an existing customer

These kind of ideas can come from anywhere, but how do good business ideas occur and how are they determined to be great?

> Ideas are plentiful. They are a dime a dozen.

> The best ideas are worth their weight in gold.

**This is the problem:** How do you separate the wheat from the chaff?

The best companies in the world realize that [the best ideas can come from anywhere](http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/ideas-can-come-from-anywhere). These ideas can come internally, your customers, board members, mentors, peers, advisors or the larger community that you and your business are a part of.

Being open to these new game-changing ideas can put your business at a distinct competitive advantage, assuming that you are well equipped to quickly capture, evaluate, build and act on them.

However, sometimes ideas need a while to germinate…they are simply too young and un-tested to begin to take hold yet.

The best thing to do in this case is simply get the idea out of your head and into the world as fast as possible to give it time and space to take root.

> Great ideas often arise at the speed of thought.

> And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished. — Johny Ive, [https://youtu.be/nPUsuY8JZJI?t=3048](https://youtu.be/nPUsuY8JZJI?t=3048)

> _Similarly_,

> “**Creativity is just connecting things**. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, **they just saw something.**”

[Steve Jobs — **_Wired_, February, 1996**](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/10/20/i-steve-steve-jobs-in-his-own-words/)

Ok, so that’s all well and good, but let’s assume for a moment that you aren’t Steve Jobs. Fair assumption?

Where then will _your_ great ideas come from?

#### **Great ideas come your team**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5Vo2ZjOSH4mGGbUtjHOCLQ.png)

Being uniquely ‘_close to the problem_’ that your company is facing, puts members of your team at a uniquely advantaged position to be able to quickly conceive of and identify ideas that could help solve real problems.

Conversely, this can also put them at a relative disadvantage in spotting the obvious problems with their ideas due to fact they are so close to the problem.

Importantly, ideas from your team can also come by way of competitors. Don’t forget the now infamous quote.

> Good artists borrow, great artists steal. — Pablo Picasso

Great ideas are not the same as other kinds of thoughts, concepts or tasks, however. You must be careful not to manage ideas and suggestions from your team alongside your other well-defined tasks, these [don’t belong in your scrum backlog](http://www.quora.com/Should-ideas-and-suggestions-be-in-your-scrum-backlog).

#### Great ideas come from your customers

Your customers can be the source of many great ideas, just make sure not to [listen to closely](http://www.getdigsy.com/blog/small-business/listening-to-customers-almost-killed-our-startup/) or act upon everything that they say.

Customer generated ideas can go a long way in exposing problems, but they often don’t have the proper context or technical know-how [to suggest optimal solutions](https://blog.intercom.io/you-are-not-in-the-bridge-building-business/).

#### Great ideas come from your community

Many great ideas exist outside of the building in the minds of your developer ecosystem, suppliers, contractors, advisors, investors and other ‘super fans’ that interact with you and all make up your community.

Often confused with the so-called ‘_wisdom of the crowds_’, great ideas from your community are not equivalent to the consensus opinion of a group.

Great ideas are singular in nature. They often come from individual community members, who have a particular valuable viewpoint that is relevant to your own context as a business.

#### A platform for ideas…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*rcd_YAITuD_b4Bbo1xbUVg.jpeg)

Currently ideas live in many places, strewn throughout private email exchanges, text messages, in-person & phone conversations, slack channels and public online articles and forums.

> What’s needed in order to provide a fertile environment for these ideas to grow?

**Hypothesis #1:** A Visual medium can transmit ideas faster and more effectively than other mediums.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Mmn4XOC2CeXKt9MP5eOlgw.png)

[http://neomam.com/blog/13reasons/](http://neomam.com/blog/13reasons/)

Conveying an idea is difficult with only text or during conversation. Great ideas are expressed more easily in mediums with higher information density or lower ‘[data-ink ratio](http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php/Data-Ink_Ratio)’.

**Hypothesis #2:** Great ideas need to be exposed to feedback ([just the right amount](http://tomtunguz.com/feedback-loops/)) in order to blossom, evolve & grow.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6qHXsZovyr3WbYq7AbDnAA.png)

[The **_right_** kind of feedback](https://zurb.com/university/lessons/solicit-the-right-types-of-feedback) can go a long way in helping an idea take shape.

e.g: 1) Ask the right people. 2) Be specific. 3) Take Notes.

**Hypothesis #3:** Great ideas need analogs to be fully understood.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*YtTHVJR_xnft5Q46geI7qA.jpeg)

[http://eet.sdsu.edu/eetwiki/index.php/Visual\_analogies\_as\_an\_instructional_tool](http://eet.sdsu.edu/eetwiki/index.php/Visual_analogies_as_an_instructional_tool)

It’s hard to conceive of any idea that isn’t in some way based off of something else that already exists today, therefore analogies & metaphor matter for the transmission of ideas.

Often the point of any analogical argument is just to persuade people [to take an idea seriously](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-analogy/). Metaphor in itself [is a sort of cognitive prism](https://books.google.com/books?id=mCjHW8pyT5MC&pg=PA254&lpg=PA254&dq=cognitive+prism&source=bl&ots=wDiLkwBCBS&sig=ML0E7hIjf6YeDxV7EhEsCUVDJF8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CE8Q6AEwB2oVChMIjLLH8eTyxgIVVCqICh2negkF#v=onepage&q=cognitive%20prism&f=false) that can add structure to ideas and make them more easily understood.

**Hypothesis #4:** Ideas benefit from being exposed to a [diversity of viewpoints](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*Y2vaR06GMwDjC7xfiplzBQ.jpeg)

[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/)

> Large data-set studies have an obvious limitation: they only show that diversity is correlated with better performance, not that it causes better performance. Research on racial diversity in small groups, however, makes it possible to draw some causal conclusions. Again, the findings are clear: for groups that value innovation and new ideas, diversity helps.

**Hypothesis #5:** Most ideas (both good and bad ones) fade out too quickly, un-captured, un-shared, un-documented.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6JGdMv3RZ0Idtn5P0apy4g.png)

Even the best ideas are often too fleeting to be pinned down.

In order to capture the best ones you must trap your ideas as they happen. In the digital realm, very light weight tools like the screenshot exist to capture an idea’s trigger, in the moment.

> What’s needed now isn’t **_more_** ideas. What’s needed now is a platform for collecting & vetting ideas that allows the good ones take hold and the bad ones fall by the wayside…

What’s needed now is a platform for quickly and easily capturing the ideas of others and building off them by adding the right amount of structure and context so that they can be more easily shared, consumed, debated, discovered, tested and refined.
