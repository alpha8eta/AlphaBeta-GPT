Our Ten Core Principles
=======================

No managers.

* * *

### Our Ten Core Principles

1.  End-to-end Employees (No people managers)
2.  Relentless Resourcefulness.
3.  Seek advice, not approval nor consensus.
4.  Work can be done anytime, anywhere.
5.  Minimize Long-term planning **(**maximize long-term thinking**)**.
6.  Don’t throw sh**t over the wall.
7.  Default to transparency.
8.  As few structured meetings as possible.
9.  Pull in the help you need.
10. Act like an adult. Get treated like one.

**End-to-end Employees (No people managers)**

* We believe in self-management.
* _You_ are your own personal manager.
* _You_ decide how to spend your time.
* _You_ let others have your best ideas.
* _Be yourself_. There is no one higher up to please or impress.
* _You_ are responsible for your own work product.

**Relentless Resourcefulness.**

* Being resourceful means looking to buy vs looking to build.
* Being resourceful means automating manual work so you don’t have to repeat yourself.
* Being resourceful means not paying full price for anything when you don’t have to and walking the fine line between moving fast and breaking shit and cutting corners that end up coming back to bite you.

**Seek advice, not approval nor consensus for decision making.**

* When a decision needs to get made that falls within your sphere of authority, you are the ultimate decision maker.
* As with any other matter you should consult with those directly effected with your decision to seek their advice on the matter.
* This does not mean that you should seek consensus before making a decision! More often than not, there will be some that disagree with your decision.
* Decisions are not permanent and can be reversed in light of new data.

**Minimize long-term planning (maximize long-term thinking).**

* In general, long term forecasting and planning is highly discouraged.
* This does not mean we don’t think towards the long-term. In fact the opposite is true.
* Co-ordination for longer term initiatives should take the form of an ad-hoc advisory committee which should be disbanded once a decision is made.

**Don’t throw shit over the wall.**

* Not throwing shit over the wall means taking responsibility for your actions and not relying on someone else to pick up the slack.
* This also means good communication is essential. Communication is the enemy of walls.

**Work can be done anytime, anywhere.**

* We believe that left to their own devices, people are generally trustworthy and should be treated as responsible adults.
* This means that if you feel like you are more productive working from home you can work from home or whichever environment you choose.
* With this added responsibility comes increased accountability for making sure you are constantly communicating and making visible the effort of your work in different ways.

**Default to transparency**

* This means sharing more information than you feel comfortable with.
* This means being the recipient of all the information you would want to have access to make informed decisions.
* We believe in open source as a guiding principle. Open sourcing code. Open sourcing knowledge from within the company with others.

**As few structured meetings as possible.**

* We believe that meetings are toxic to productivity.
* Ad-hoc meetings are acceptable as long as they are short (15 minutes ideally) and have clear decisions being made by the end to take action.

**Pull in the help you need.**

* We expect engineers to pull help from designers (and vice versa). We expect designers to push help on the engineers (and vice versa).
* Pull help from whomever is best at X, but don’t let them be a bottleneck. And expect strong feedback from people who are better at X.

**Act like an adult, get treated like one.**

* No vacation time limits — take as much as you need.
* Bring your full personal identity with you to work. You are more than your professional persona.
