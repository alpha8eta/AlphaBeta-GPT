### Bridge Academy Spring 2019: Fellowship ProgramðŸŽ–An Open CallÂ ðŸ—£

Weâ€™re on the lookout for the top rising talent on the bleeding edge of technology development.

We started [Bridge Academy in late 2018](https://medium.com/the-spectrum/%C6%80uilding-a-%C6%80ridge-to-the-%C6%80lockchain-economy-c1a25fd119bd) as a solution to the problem of the talent and opportunity gaps that exist today specifically within the blockchain industry and on the edge of new technology development more broadly.

We believe that being open to the entire worldâ€™s supply of talent is a key to finding the next generation of developers that will push the frontiers of this technology, which is why Bridge allows participation from anywhere.

**_Today_** we are announcing a search for the next cohort of Bridge Fellows, who will be given full scholarships to our training programs along with their own personal mentor.

2.  You may recommend as many potential fellows as you like.
3.  We will tally all the recommendations and invite the top 5% of recommended applicants to join the fellowship program.
4.  The deadline for submissions is February 28th, 2019.

**Note**: you may ask someone to recommend you as well as apply to be recommended yourself (though we wonâ€™t count self-recommendations).
