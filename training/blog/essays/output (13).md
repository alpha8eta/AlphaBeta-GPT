### “These Ads Suck”

_A lesson in building a culture of problem solving._

As the now legendary story goes,

> One Friday afternoon in 2002, long before his company became a household verb, Larry Page walked into the office kitchen and posted some printouts of results from Google’s AdWords engine. On top, in big bold letters he wrote:

> **_“THESE ADS SUCK.”_**

What followed next was surprising:

> By early Monday morning, a group of engineers sent out an email with a solution that not only resolved the AdWords problem, but helped transform Google into a major money machine. The episode exemplifies how Google has built a culture that attacks problems — not people . — [The Google way of attacking problems](https://hbr.org/2014/12/the-google-way-of-attacking-problems)

#### Why did this work?

1.  **A strong culture of accountability and ownership — **First and foremost, Google already had a culture of accountability and ownership. Since the engineering team felt responsibility for the quality of their code and ownership over the Google search product, they were open to taking this feedback and responding to it.
2.  **No one person was singled out — **By posting the search result anonymously where everyone could see it, Larry Page made sure that the right audience got to see it (the search engineers) and that no single person was called out or blamed for the result, which would have happened if he sent it out to a particular engineer or engineering team manager.

As it turns out, often times, simply surfacing the problems can be sufficient.

> The worst problems are those that we can’t see. Yet most training focuses on how to solve problems. This assumes that we know how to surface problems and are surfacing the right ones. No matter how good we get at solving problems, it doesn’t do any good if we’re not solving the right ones. — [_Jamie Flinchbaugh_](http://www.industryweek.com/flinchbaugh)

So, what are some problems you are facing in your company and why aren’t you talking about them?
