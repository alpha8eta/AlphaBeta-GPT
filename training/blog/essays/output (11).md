### Jobs-to-be-Done: Hiring Mobile Screenshots

Applying the JTBD framework to the jobs we hire mobile screenshots for.

Taking a screenshot on the iPhone is such a simple action, it’s no wonder so many people are taking more and more screenshots than ever before.

The fact remains, no-one ever takes screenshots without a some kind of intent behind it ([see #3](https://medium.com/@adambreckler/prism-lens-beta-v-2-ca680c891206#.i59h3xtt0)). The goal certainly isn’t to fill up our camera rolls.

Re-framing this intent using the ‘[**_Jobs-to-be-Done_**](https://medium.com/the-job-to-be-done)’ framework we’re able to come up with a list of jobs that people frequently ‘_hire_’ screenshots for. What follows is a list of these jobs with example screenshots.

* * *

#1) Hiring mobile screenshots for — **saving inspiration**. Keeping track of inspirations for later use when the time is right to take action. The problem is, I rarely am able to find them again once saved, leaving my camera roll cluttered with screenshots as reminders that were never found again.
