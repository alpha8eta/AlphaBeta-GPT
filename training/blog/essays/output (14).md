### Prism.IO April Update

We’ve been busy making [Prism.IO](http://prism.io) more powerful, easy-to-use, and beautiful. Here are some the changes we rolled out over the past few weeks:

* * *

1) We recently added two new feedback formats including:

* **Tier 1** ($3**)** — Static Screenshot ([see example](https://app.prism.io/#tier1))
* **Tier 2** ($6) — Screenshot + Reaction ([see example](https://app.prism.io/#tier2))

Of course, we’ll continue to offer our standard 5-minute screen recording as ‘Tier 3’.

2) In order to reflect these new feedback formats and make our pricing simpler, **we updated our pricing packages**. You can try out our new pricing calculator by clicking the image below.

3) Finally, we recently **released our much anticipated iOS recording SDK**, which allows companies to integrate our app recording technology straight within their iOS apps.

Here’s a peek of the sdk in action (just shake to record)

We’re really excited about these updates and hope you are too!
